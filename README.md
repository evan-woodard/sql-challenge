A project utilizing SQL functionality


The premise of the project is as follows:

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.


The tasks of the project were to create an ERD to visualize the data, create the database for the information data, import the CSV files into the database, and output the results of specified queries of the data.


The queries to be run:

1. The employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. The first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3. The manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. The department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. First name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6. Each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. The frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
